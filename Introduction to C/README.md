# Introduction to the Unix Command Line & C
This project involves an introduction to Unix command line usage and C programming, focusing on practical exercises to familiarize with basic Unix commands and the C compilation process. Participants are required to take screenshots of every command executed, use specific Unix commands to navigate and manipulate files, and compile three C files (hello.c, image.c, converter.c) using the gcc compiler. The assignment emphasizes the importance of organizing project files and understanding the output of compiled C programs. The project culminates in a submission of a compiled PDF document containing all relevant screenshots and executables.
