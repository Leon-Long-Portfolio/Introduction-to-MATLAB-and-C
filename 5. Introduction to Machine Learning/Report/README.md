# Modelling risk for Coronary Heart Disease
Welcome to our project on modeling the risk of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) using machine learning. This project is rooted in the understanding that CHD is a leading cause of death globally, necessitating the development of efficient and innovative diagnostic tools. Our approach leverages data from the renowned Framingham Heart Study, incorporating major risk factors for CHD, and utilizes MATLAB's machine learning toolbox for analysis. The process includes data scrubbing and preparation, analysis through histograms and heatmaps to understand the distribution and correlation of various risk factors, and the application of logistic regression models for risk prediction. We critically evaluate our models' accuracy and precision, recognizing the challenges in achieving reliable predictions due to sample size limitations and the complexity of CHD risk factors. This repository documents our journey through this intricate task, offering insights into the potentials and limitations of applying machine learning in cardiovascular disease prediction.
