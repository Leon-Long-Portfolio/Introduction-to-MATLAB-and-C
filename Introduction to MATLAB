This homework assignment focuses on utilizing MATLAB Mobile, an application that enables MATLAB to interact with smartphone sensors for data collection. The task involves engaging in a physical activity such as sprinting, doing jumping jacks, or cycling up a hill, and recording the data. This data will then be used to write a program and analyze the movement, exploring various parameters like acceleration, velocity, and position. The assignment is designed to be creative and enjoyable, encouraging collaboration, friendly competition, and practical application of classroom concepts.
