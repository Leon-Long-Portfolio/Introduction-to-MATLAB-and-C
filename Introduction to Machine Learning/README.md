# Introduction to Machine Learning
The project for the Machine Learning course at Boston University primarily focuses on the practical application of machine learning techniques to solve real-world societal problems. Students are required to use MATLAB's Machine Learning Toolbox for analyzing large datasets, with a minimum of 20,000 data points, to derive meaningful insights. A significant aspect of the project is to ensure that the chosen problems and solutions have a positive impact on society. Furthermore, the project emphasizes the importance of ethical considerations in AI development, particularly in understanding and addressing biases in datasets and algorithms. This comprehensive approach aims to equip students with both technical skills in machine learning and a deep awareness of the societal and ethical implications of their work in AI.
